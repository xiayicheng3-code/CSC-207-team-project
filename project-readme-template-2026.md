## Project Description

A research paper manager that links bio-informatics paper and link papers based on genes mentioned. 

### Domain

Productivity/ Acedemic Research

## User Stories

## 1. Search the Paper

### User Story 1.1  Search Papers
As a bioinformatics student, I want to find research papers about genes of interest, so that I can conduct my research in an organized manner.

### User Story 1.2  Adjust Search Result Count
As a bioinformatics student, I want to change the number of papers shown on the search results page, so that I can control how many papers I review at once.

### User Story 1.3  View Paper Details
As a researcher, I want to view a paper's URL, title, authors, and abstract, so that I can determine whether the paper is relevant to my research.

## 2. Build Personal Paper Library

### User Story 2.1  Save Papers
As a researcher, I want to save links to research papers, so that I can easily access them again in the future.

### User Story 2.2  Remove Papers
As a researcher, I want to remove papers from my saved collection, so that I can keep my research library focused on the most relevant and useful literature.

### User Story 2.3  Organize Papers by Gene
As a bioinformatics student, I want to organize papers based on different genes, so that I can learn about their relationships with my genes of interest.

### User Story 2.4  View Saved Papers
As a researcher, I want to view all my saved papers, so that I can easily access and review my research collection.

### User Story 2.5  View Papers by Gene
As a researcher, I want to view my saved papers under different gene categories, so that I can find literature associated with a specific gene.

## 3. Gene Interaction Management

### User Story 3.1  Add Genes
As a bioinformatics student, I want to add genes of interest to my collection, so that I can organize and explore their biological relationships.

### User Story 3.2  Remove Genes
As a bioinformatics student, I want to remove genes from my collection, so that I can keep my gene collection relevant to my research.

### User Story 3.3  Open Genes in Genome Browser
As a bioinformatics student, I want to open genes in the UCSC Genome Browser, so that I can explore their genomic locations and related information.

### User Story 3.4  Create Gene Relationships
As a researcher, I want to create relationships between different genes, so that I can record and organize their biological interactions.

### User Story 3.5  Edit Gene Relationships
As a researcher, I want to edit existing gene relationships, so that I can update the information based on new research findings.

### User Story 3.6  Remove Gene Relationships
As a researcher, I want to remove existing gene relationships, so that I can correct inaccurate or outdated information.

### User Story 3.7  Visualize Gene Relationships
As a bioinformatics student, I want to visualize relationships between genes in a graph, so that I can better understand how different genes interact with each other.

## 4. PDF Management

### User Story 4.1  Upload PDFs
As a researcher, I want to upload research papers in PDF format, so that I can store and manage my research materials in one place.

### User Story 4.2 Associate PDFs with Papers
As a researcher, I want to associate uploaded PDFs with papers in my personal library, so that I can easily access the full text of my saved papers.

### User Story 4.3 Open PDFs
As a researcher, I want to open uploaded PDFs, so that I can read the full text of research papers.

### User Story 4.4 Delete PDFs
As a researcher, I want to delete uploaded PDFs, so that I can remove unnecessary files from my research library.

## Optional User Stories (If Time Permits)

### User Story 4.5 Extract Text from PDFs
As a researcher, I want to extract text from uploaded PDFs, so that I can easily access and use information from research papers.

### User Story 4.6 View PDFs Inside the Application
As a researcher, I want to view uploaded PDFs directly within the application, so that I can read research papers without opening an external PDF reader.

## 5. Comment the Paper

### User Story 5.1 Add Comments
As a researcher, I want to write comments under a paper's abstract, so that I can keep track of what the paper is talking about and share key information extracted from it.

### User Story 5.2 Edit Comments
As a researcher, I want to edit my previous comments, so that I can correct mistakes or update information based on new findings.

### User Story 5.3  Delete Comments
As a researcher, I want to delete my previous comments, so that I can remove outdated or irrelevant information.

### User Story 5.4  View Comments
As a researcher, I want to view comments under research papers, so that I can review previously recorded information and learn from other researchers' discussions.

## 6. Manage User Account

### User Story 6.1 Create Account
As a user, I want to create an account, so that my personal research records can be kept private and secure.

### User Story 6.2 Log In
As a user, I want to log into my account, so that I can access my saved papers, comments, and other research records.

### User Story 6.3 Log Out
As a user, I want to log out of my account, so that the next person opening the application cannot access or modify my personal research records.
